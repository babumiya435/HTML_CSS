    - it represents the HTML5 verision 
    (browsers can take it as HTML5 version document and can undersatand newer elements without throwing errors).
    - HTML Version Declaration
    - Standards Mode Activation - consistent rendering across different browsers.
    - Quirks Mode Prevention - which occurs when the browser attempts to render the document in a way that is compatible with older, 
        non-standardized versions of HTML
    - Improved Parsing Efficiency - It ensures that the browser follows the rules and syntax of the HTML5 specification, 
        leading to more predictable rendering behavior.
